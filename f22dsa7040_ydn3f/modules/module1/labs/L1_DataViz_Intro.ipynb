    "\n",
    "This is your first lab for the Data Visualization course. We will cover the fundamentals of visualization concepts and technologies. We will start with the principles of data visualization, human visual perception; and then we will learn how to select the appropriate visualization methods for various types of data, and we will implement our visualizations in R and Python using several libraries such as ggplot2 and plotly. We will also refer to the slides as we go through the labs. For this lab, we will refer to the slides in the file  [L1_DataViz_Intro.pdf](L1_DataViz_Intro.pdf) (you can right-click and save the pdf document)."

    "## What is data visualization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is the visual representation of data in order to explore, discover, analyze, and gain insight about the phenomena. This facet of the visualization is mainly about understanding data better through visual representation. The other facet of data visualization is to effectively communicate ideas, convey a consistent message, and convince people. So, we have several types of visualization depending on the purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scientific visualization** (SciVis): SciVis is the visualization of the structured data, usually in 3D, in order to simulate or recreate real, physical models such as storm forecasting, seismic data, fluid dynamics, medical image visualization, etc. (**slide #5** in [L1_DataViz_Intro.pdf](L1_DataViz_Intro.pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/scivis.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Information visualization** (InfoVis): This usually covers all kinds of data with or without any inherent structure and can span from statistical plots with mathematical accuracy to the infographics that we see in newspapers or news web sites. It can be relational (networks of data items such as facebook connections), geographical (maps), or simple measurements or time series such as stock market data. The main purpose of this type of visualization is to effectively communicate a message\n",
    "(**slide #6** in [L1_DataViz_Intro.pdf](L1_DataViz_Intro.pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/infovis.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visual Analytics**: **This is the visualization of data to explore and *gain insight* toward understanding some phenomenon in the data** (correlations, clusters, outliers, etc.) which helps us to choose the right mathematical and statistical tools to analyze the data.\n"

    "## Why visualize data ? \n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed above, **we visualize the data either to explore and understand it, or to communicate a message.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why can't we simply use some mathematical tools to get an understanding of the data, or why can't we use words, descriptions to communicate a message ? Human visual perception is a very well developed system that is an integral part of our perception of the world. We can use it to our advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's look at an example. How many letter V's do you see in here ?** \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/numberofvs.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to say, we need to go through it one by one and count. Now look at the this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/numberofvs2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "V's are distinctively colored, and **we can immediately count them**. Our visual perception, as we will see later, can process visual elements with some distinction much faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, for the data analysis purpose, we can exploit the human visual perception in order to easily explore and discover characteristics, or relationships in the data. For the communication purposes, we can exploit the same in order to represent the data in a manner that is suitable to convey an idea or message effectively.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will see another simple example where we can gain much better insight on data by simply visualizing it rather than using mathematical and statistical tools. \n"
