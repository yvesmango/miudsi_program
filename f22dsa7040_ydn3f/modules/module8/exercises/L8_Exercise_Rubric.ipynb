    "# Module 8 Exercise - Data Storytelling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will **create a data story product with a data set of your choosing**. You can choose any data set you can find on the Internet or a data set related to your current line of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will create visualizations to give a message, make a point, or convince your audience by using all the techniques we have \n",
    "seen throughout the course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is about creating a quickly consumable product; Do **NOT** create a report or lengthy power point presentation. You can choose a **poster format** or **few slides** to tell your story (with a unique angle) from the conclusions you derive for the audience you have decided. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Here is a list of your tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a data set and upload it to your exercises folder in module 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write your R code **in THIS exercise notebook** to create your visualizations, and save them under the `exercises` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a **narrative visualization document** using **any** software you want (Word, PowerPoint, Photoshop, Adobe, etc.) by **pasting your visualizations and creating all necessary elements** (captions, text annotations, layout, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Save your end product as a **PDF FILE** and upload it to your exercises folder (**MAKE SURE TO NAME IT L8_Exercise.pdf**)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start with a clear message or angle in your mind for your audience, and filter and format your data accordingly, and create the visualizations that will **support that message**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have **at least one major visualization, and a number of supporting smaller graphs (2, 3, or more)** in a nice layout. Make sure to have a **clean layout** they can follow, and **enough text annotations and captions** to make your message/point clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the **good and bad examples** in the lab notebook and consult the links. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose any type of visualization that you believe will be most **effective** for the type of data, characteristics of the data, visual tasks, and the message you have chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded by the quality of your visualizations and storytelling; **make sure to use every principle you have learned in this course.** \n",
