    "In this lab, we will cover visualization design principles set forth by Edward Tufte. We will cover concepts of graphical integrity, lie factor, data-ink ratio, data density, chart junk, etc. and briefly introduce the visualization analysis that will be covered in the next module.

    "Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data. It's a matter of\n",
    "substance, of statistics, and of design. Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas\n",
    "communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical excellence gives to the viewer the **greatest number of ideas** in the **shortest time** with the **least ink** in the **smallest space**. Graphical excellence is nearly always multivariate and requires telling the truth about the data. \n",

    "### Graphical Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "It is simply telling the truth about data. **The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity.\n",
    "Data variation, not design variation should be shown. The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data. Graphics must not quote data out of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Missing Scales, Scale Distortions \n",
    "\n",
    "The data has to be shown in **accurate scales** and within context. The following image does not have a scale or axis; comparisons between the bars can be misleading.\n",
