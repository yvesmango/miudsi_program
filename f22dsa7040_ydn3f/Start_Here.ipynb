    "# Welcome to DATA_SCI 7040 Big Data Visualization \n",
    "\n",
    "This course will cover visualization techniques and methods for a broad range of data types prevalent in engineering disciplines, life sciences, media, and business. Theoretical and practical aspects of information visualization and exploratory data visualization will be taught with a hands-on approach to give students experience in handling data with a set of tools and programming environments. Topics will include visual perception and distortions, color theory, preattentive processing, data types and models, visual variables, efficient visualizations, design principles, grammar of graphics, spatial visualization, maps, graph theory network visualization, data storytelling including hands-on programming to create plots, charts, heatmaps, spatial and network visualizations using R and Python libraries.\n",

Modules are 7 days long from Saturday to the Saturday of the following week. **The only component that must be completed by a particular day is the discussion as the other students will be required to respond to several submissions. Posting by the intended date will allow others adequate time to respond to your post.** \n",
